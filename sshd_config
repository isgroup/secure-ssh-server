# THIS CONFIGURATION DOES NOT INCLUDE DEFAULTS OF OpenSSH >= 6
# AS THEY ARE, YOU KNOW, DEFAULTS! ONLY CLEAN AND LEAN CONF :)

# IP and port
Port 22
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0

# HostKeys for protocol version 2
#
# /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key are
# disabled as "NIST Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) with SHA-1 hash"
# and "RSA with SHA-1 hash" as SHA-1 is no longer considered secure
# (see shattered.io).
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

# Use kernel sandbox mechanisms where possible in 
# unprivileged processes
# 
# If UsePrivilegeSeparation is set to "sandbox" then the
# pre-authentication unprivileged process is subject to
# additional restrictions
UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox

# Authentication
PermitRootLogin without-password

# Change to yes to enable challenge-response passwords
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
PasswordAuthentication no

PrintMotd no

# Anti-DoS
#
# Random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three 
# colon separated values “start:rate:full” (e.g. "10:30:60").
# sshd(8) will refuse connection attempts with a probability
# of “rate/100” (30%) if there are currently “start” (10)
# unauthenticated connections. The probability increases
# linearly and all connection attempts are refused if the
# number of unauthenticated connections reaches “full” (60).
MaxStartups 10:30:60

# Auditing
# 
# Log sftp level file access (read/write/etc.) that would 
# not be easily logged otherwise
Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server -f AUTHPRIV -l INFO

# LogLevel VERBOSE logs user's key fingerprint on login. Needed to 
# have a clear audit track of which key was using to log in.
